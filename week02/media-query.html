            <p>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom;
                that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow
                beings ye are only in the service of your God.</p>

            <h1>1 Nephi 19:23</h1>
            <p>And I did read many things unto them which were written in the books of Moses;
                but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their
                Redeemer I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet Isaiah;
                for I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning.</p>
