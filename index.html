                I love everything related to design, creativity web design and e-commerce. I have been married for almost 20 years and I am father of 4 children, the oldest is serving his mission in Puerto Rico and it is 
                one of the things that makes me happy. Another thing that I really like is music and musical instruments, I like to play the piano and the accordion, I like to learn something new every day and it is one of my goals to do so 
                as well as share the knowledge that I obtain with others. I feel grateful for Jesus Christ in my life and I strive to make him a central part of my life and that of my family.</p>
